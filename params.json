{"name":"Antitaintdroid","tagline":"AntiTaintDroid - Escaping Taint Analysis (and stealing private information) on Android for Fun and Profit","body":"AntiTaintDroid (a.k.a. ScrubDroid)\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n[AntiTaintDroid][3] (a.k.a. [ScrubDroid][1]) is a proof-of-concept Android application offering a working implementation of the techniques presented in our [SECRYPT 2013][1] which can be exploited to bypass the security protections offered by [TaintDroid][2], a real-time privacy monitoring mechanism based on dynamic taint analysis. TaintDroid is a joint collaboration between [Intel Labs][4], [Penn State][5], [Duke University][6] and [U.S. National Science Foundation][7]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Quick Installation Guide###\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to be hassled with compiling the app yourself, you may just follow the workflow below:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n  git clone git@github.com:gsbabil/AntiTaintDroid.git # checkout my source-code\r\n  cd AntiTaintDroid # change current directory to AntiTaintDroid\r\n  adb install bin/AntiTaintDroid.apk # install the app on your phone/emulator\r\n  cd AntiTaintDroi/AntiTaintDroid-Server # change directory to AntiTaintDroid server\r\n  python antitaintdroid-server.py # runs the server\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Compiling the code###\r\n\r\nI have included both the Eclipse and Ant project files. You should just be able to import it in Eclipse and hit the `Run` button. Or, you can just do `ant debug install` to compile and install it on your TaintDroid phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n###How it works###\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms to bypass TaintDroid protections are elaborated in our [paper][1]. Also, the code itself if pretty self-explanatory. Just go through `UntaintTricks.java` and you should be fine. You should note that the way this PoC app works is - first it collects some private information (e.g. IMEI, Android ID etc.) from the phone with `collectPrivateData()` and then it tries to leak it over the network. Where the data is leaked to depends on where you run the server component. AntiTaintDroid PoC comes with a simple Python server which you can find in `AntiTaintDroid-Server` directory. Just make sure that you `cd` inside the `AntiTaintDroid-Server` directory and then run the `python antitaintdroid-server.py` script. The server should start a very simple web-server on port `8000`. Now you can go back to the app and hit `menu > settings` to specify your server IP address and port number. That's it! Now you are ready to try all the AntiTaintDroid tricks. Each time you tap on a trick, some private data (depending on what you have in `collectPrivateData()`) should be stolen, leaked to your server (`antitaintdroid-server.py` will print it on the console) and of course there won't be any TaintDroid notification to alert you that your IMEI has just been stolen.
